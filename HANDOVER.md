## 🔄 Data Flow Between Customer & Vendor

### 📱 Customer → Vendor Data Flow

1. **Order Placement Flow:**
   ```
   Customer (MainApp) → Order Created → Vendor Dashboard (Order Queue)
   ├── Order details sync to vendor dashboard
   ├── Customer preferences/customizations transferred
   ├── Payment information processed
   └── Notification sent to vendor
   ```

2. **Menu Browsing Flow:**
   ```
   Vendor Menu Updates → Customer Menu Display
   ├── Menu items availability sync
   ├── Pricing updates propagate
   ├── New items appear in customer app
   └── Sold out items get disabled
   ```

### 🏪 Vendor → Customer Data Flow

1. **Order Status Updates:**
   ```
   Vendor Dashboard → Order Status Change → Customer App
   ├── Order accepted/rejected notifications
   ├── Preparation time estimates
   ├── Ready for pickup/delivery alerts
   └── Completion confirmations
   ```

2. **Menu Management Impact:**
   ```
   Vendor Dashboard Menu Changes → Customer Side Updates
   ├── Real-time availability updates
   ├── Price changes sync immediately
   ├── New menu items appear
   └── Category changes reflected
   ```

### 🔄 Bidirectional Synchronization Points

- **Menu Data:** Changes in vendor dashboard instantly reflect in customer browsing
- **Order Status:** Real-time updates between vendor dashboard and customer tracking
- **Availability:** Restaurant online/offline status affects customer discovery
- **Reviews:** Customer reviews appear in vendor communications center
- **Messages:** Customer inquiries route to vendor communication panel

## 🎨 Design System Integration

### DeliGo Glass Design Language
- **Primary Colors:** Orange (#f97316) for CTAs, cream/amber backgrounds
- **Glassmorphism:** All cards use `bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-sm` effects
- **Mobile-First:** Optimized for 393x852 viewport with safe area support
- **Bilingual:** Full English/Kinyarwanda support throughout

### Component Consistency
- **Customer Components:** Consistent navigation, bottom tab bar, search patterns
- **Vendor Components:** Unified dashboard tabs, real-time updates, action buttons
- **Shared Patterns:** Glass cards, orange CTAs, consistent typography, 44px touch targets

---

## 🚀 Production Deployment Architecture

### Current Mock Data Structure
All components use structured mock data that mirrors expected API responses:

**Customer Side Mock Data:**
- `mockRestaurants` - Restaurant listings with ratings, cuisine types, delivery info
- `mockMenuItems` - Complete menu with categories, prices, availability
- `mockOrders` - Order history with status tracking and details
- `mockReviews` - Customer reviews and ratings
- `mockNotifications` - Push notification history

**Vendor Side Mock Data:**
- `mockOrders` - Incoming order queue with customer details
- `mockMenuItems` - Vendor's menu for management
- `mockAnalytics` - Revenue and performance data
- `mockMessages` - Customer communications
- `mockNotifications` - Vendor-specific alerts

### Integration Ready Points
Every component is structured with clear separation between:
- **UI Logic** - React components and state management
- **Data Layer** - Mock data clearly marked for API replacement
- **Business Logic** - Order processing, menu management, payment handling

---

## 📱 Mobile-First Considerations

### Touch Optimization
- **Minimum touch targets:** 44px (h-12 classes)
- **Scroll optimization:** Custom scrollbar hiding and momentum scrolling
- **Safe area support:** Full iPhone/Android notch and home indicator support
- **Gesture support:** Swipe actions, pull-to-refresh patterns

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy loading** for restaurant images and menu items
- **Virtualized lists** for large restaurant/menu catalogs
- **Optimistic updates** for cart and order management
- **Cached data** for frequently accessed restaurants and menus

---

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### State Management
- **React Hooks:** useState, useEffect for local component state
- **Props Drilling:** Clean parent-child communication patterns
- **Context Ready:** Architecture supports React Context for global state

### Component Hierarchy
```
App.tsx (Router & Auth)
├── Customer Flow
│   └── MainApp.tsx (Customer State Container)
│       ├── Navigation Components
│       ├── Screen Components
│       └── Modal Components
└── Vendor Flow
    └── VendorDashboardFixed.tsx (Complete Vendor System)
        ├── Order Management
        ├── Menu Management
        ├── Analytics
        └── Communications
```

### Data Persistence Patterns
- **Local Storage:** User preferences, cart contents, language settings
- **Session Storage:** Temporary order data, search history
- **API Integration Points:** Clearly marked throughout codebase

---

## 🔒 Security & Authentication

### Current Authentication Flow
- **Role-based routing** in App.tsx
- **Guest access** for browsing (upgradeable to authenticated)
- **Vendor authentication** for dashboard access
- **Session management** ready for implementation

### Security Considerations
- **Payment processing** - Mock implementation ready for real payment gateway
- **User data protection** - Components structured for GDPR compliance
- **API security** - Token-based authentication patterns prepared
- **Input validation** - Form validation patterns implemented

---

## 🌐 Internationalization (i18n)

### Bilingual Implementation
- **Language State:** Managed at App.tsx level, passed down to all components
- **Content Objects:** Every component has `content[language]` objects
- **Consistent Pattern:** English ('en') and Kinyarwanda ('rw') support
- **Extensible:** Architecture supports additional languages

### Text Content Structure
```typescript
const content = {
  en: { /* English content */ },
  rw: { /* Kinyarwanda content */ }
};

// Usage throughout app
<h1>{content[language].title}</h1>
```

---

## 📈 Analytics & Monitoring Ready

### Built-in Analytics Points
- **User Journey Tracking** - Clear event points for customer flow analytics
- **Vendor Performance** - Dashboard ready for business intelligence integration
- **Order Funnel** - Complete e-commerce tracking implementation
- **Error Boundaries** - Production error handling and reporting

---
